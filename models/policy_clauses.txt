HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY DOCUMENT
Policy Number: HEALTH-2024-IND-123456
Premium Health Coverage Plan

================================================================================
SECTION 1: COVERAGE OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This policy provides comprehensive health insurance coverage up to a maximum sum insured of Rs. 5,00,000 (Five Lakh Rupees) per policy year. The coverage is designed to protect the insured against unexpected medical expenses arising from illness, injury, or hospitalization.

The policy operates on an indemnity basis, meaning the insurance company will reimburse actual medical expenses incurred, subject to policy terms, conditions, and exclusions. All claims are subject to verification and the insurer reserves the right to investigate any claim for authenticity.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: DEDUCTIBLE AND CO-PAYMENT
================================================================================

DEDUCTIBLE CLAUSE:
Every claim under this policy is subject to a mandatory deductible of Rs. 25,000 (Twenty-Five Thousand Rupees). This means that the first Rs. 25,000 of every claim will be borne by the insured. The insurance company will only be liable to pay amounts exceeding the deductible, subject to the sum insured.

The deductible applies per claim and not per policy year. If multiple claims are filed in a year, the deductible will apply to each separate claim event.

CO-PAYMENT CLAUSE:
In addition to the deductible, the insured is required to bear 10% of all admissible claims as co-payment. The co-payment is calculated on the claim amount after deducting the deductible. For example, if the total claim is Rs. 1,00,000, after deducting Rs. 25,000 deductible, the remaining Rs. 75,000 is subject to 10% co-payment (Rs. 7,500), resulting in a final payable amount of Rs. 67,500.

================================================================================
SECTION 3: WAITING PERIOD
================================================================================

INITIAL WAITING PERIOD:
All claims arising within the first 30 days of policy commencement are not covered, except for claims arising from accidents. This 30-day waiting period is designed to prevent adverse selection and ensure policy sustainability.

PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS WAITING PERIOD:
Any disease, ailment, or injury that existed before the policy start date is considered a pre-existing condition. All pre-existing conditions are subject to a waiting period of 730 days (2 years) from the policy commencement date. No claims related to pre-existing conditions will be admissible during this period.

The insured must disclose all pre-existing conditions at the time of policy purchase. Failure to disclose may result in claim rejection and policy cancellation.

SPECIFIC DISEASE WAITING PERIODS:
Certain specific diseases and procedures carry additional waiting periods:
- Cataract Surgery: 1 year
- Joint Replacement: 2 years
- Hernia: 1 year
- Hysterectomy: 1 year
- Bariatric Surgery: 2 years
- Maternity: 2 years

================================================================================
SECTION 4: ROOM RENT AND ICU LIMITS
================================================================================

ROOM RENT LIMITATION:
Hospital room charges are subject to a sub-limit of Rs. 5,000 per day. If the insured occupies a room with charges exceeding this limit, the proportionate deduction rule will apply to all other expenses including doctor fees, nursing charges, medicines, and investigations.

For example, if room rent is Rs. 10,000 per day (double the limit), all other expenses will be reduced by 50% while processing the claim.

ICU/ICCU CHARGES:
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or Intensive Cardiac Care Unit (ICCU) charges are capped at Rs. 10,000 per day. This includes all ICU-related expenses like ventilator charges, monitoring equipment, and specialized nursing.

The room rent proportionate deduction does not apply when the patient is in ICU, as ICU has a separate sub-limit.
